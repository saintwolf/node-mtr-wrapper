# Node.js Mtr-Wrapper


Node.js wrapper for the `mtr` command / tool.

This project is based heavily on https://github.com/ThatOneNeji/node-mtrext which is in-turn based on https://github.com/Kami/node-mtr 
This has been created due to the need for this library in Typescript, and also the need to configure more options in MTR.
